#Project: Tinder++

Much like how C++ is just C but better, Tinder++ is just Tinder, but better!

Our database will model users and their profiles as they interact, match, date, and chat with one another.
Businesses and users can also add date ideas and promotions.

When two users match, they will be given date ideas based on their common interests!

# Features

Our system will be able to:
* Store user profiles
* Allow users to have photos and albums
* Have suggested dates
* Location-based matching, location-based date suggestions
* Provide private chats and group chats
* Compatibility with couples to allow group dates and group chats
* ...and much more!

The different kinds of users will include:
* Regular users (looking for dates)
* Businesses (promoting their venues for date locations)


# Platform

Node.js as a frontend
SQLite as a database
